# Salary Prediction Model
This was a project done as part of our internship during First year. It is a simple model for employee salary prediction based on age provided. We built it using **Python language** in **Jupyter Notebook**. We imported the **CSV dataset** containing the employee salary and age data then after cleaning the data, we visualized it using **scatterplot**. We then split the data to train and test data and trained the model using **Linear Regression** to find the best fit line. After testing the model we got a **95.93% accuracy** and deployed the model using **streamlit** library.
